What Is A Crontab

Deffinition:  The crontab is used to automate all types of tasks on Linux systems. This is an especially important skill for aspiring system administrators to learn. 
It can be somewhat challenging to get started if youâ€™re a beginner. The syntax is different than most other commands.
For this reason, this lesson will include a little more background information before I show you some of the uses.

How Can A Attacker Use This To Thier Advantage?

Well if a hacker is able to edit a users crontab then they can put code in it telling the computer to download a file from their runing webserver and run it inorder to gain
a reverse shell!
