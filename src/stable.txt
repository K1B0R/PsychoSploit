===============================================HOW MAKE YOUR SHELL STABLE WITH PYTHON=========================================


first we need to check if your pwned machine has python installed! we can easily do this via the command "which python"

if it comes up with a result that usally looke like "/usr/bin/python"!

now in your terminal type "python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'" and then your shell should look something like this

user@machine~$

but if you do the commands "clear" or use and of the arrow keys on then keyboard it wont work so now for the last and final parts

down below i will have versions of the commands which are for "kali Linux" and "Ubuntu"
